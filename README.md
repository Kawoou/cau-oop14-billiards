Four Ball
===================
In this project, we developed a simple simulation of a “four-ball” billiard game. The billiard table as the user sees it consists of a window containing a rectangle table with 2 red balls and 1 yellow and 1 white cue balls, imparting a certain amount of energy to it. On top of that, the program also shows the time remaining for each player to hit the ball and the direction of the cue ball in a green line. By pressing the space bar the screen is changed and the user can select on which part of the ball he/she would like to hit on. Also it shows the power gauge of how strong the user will hit the ball. Once a ball has energy it will start to move, reflecting off of walls, and potentially striking other balls. When a ball strikes another ball some of the energy of the first is given to the second, while the direction of movement of the two balls is changed by the collision. The user can go back to the previous screen by pressing any arrow keys and display the score by pressing onto the tab key. The program ends when ESC key is pressed.
